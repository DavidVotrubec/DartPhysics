Port of CoffeePhysics to Dart
Because I want to learn Dart and I like CoffeePhysics.

Far from finished... 
It started mainly as an attempt to learn more about the Dart lang.
But I soon realized that I like CoffeeScript much better because of its short (unobtrusive) syntax.
Dart is about as verbose as Java or C# :(
